# terminal paint

A simple app that lets you draw in the terminal using your mouse!

Requires the windows.h header file and C++17 or newer. In Visual Studio, you can choose the version of C++ with project > Properties > C/C++ > Language > C++ Language Standard.

This app's menus were created with the [ynot library](https://github.com/wheelercj/ynot), and the drawing feature itself was built with help from [Microsoft's docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/reading-input-buffer-events).
